description: |
  Katib is a Kubernetes-native project for automated machine learning (AutoML). Katib supports Hyperparameter Tuning, Early Stopping and Neural Architecture Search.

  Katib is the project which is agnostic to machine learning (ML) frameworks. It can tune hyperparameters of applications written in any language of the usersâ€™ choice and natively supports many ML frameworks, such as TensorFlow, Apache MXNet, PyTorch, XGBoost, and others.

  Katib can perform training jobs using any Kubernetes Custom Resources with out of the box support for Kubeflow Training Operator, Argo Workflows, Tekton Pipelines and many more.
